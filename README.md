## Why we chose this topic?

We chose to focus on creating a **Google Chrome Technical Support System** because many people use Chrome for browsing the internet, and itâ€™s essential to help them solve any technical problems they encounter. By providing a simple interface and step-by-step solutions, we aim to make troubleshooting easier for users, even if theyâ€™re not tech-savvy.

## General Description

Our project focuses on developing an **expert system** application using `aima3` and `tkinter`. This
system is designed to assist users in resolving technical problems encountered while using Google
Chrome. The application organizes Chrome issues into distinct categories such as **Performance**, **Security**, **Installation**, and others.

Users can select the category relevant to their issue and respond to targeted questions to pinpoint the problem. Leveraging this information, the expert system offers potential solutions to address the identified issue.

Through this intuitive approach, our goal is to deliver an effective and user-friendly tool for diagnosing and resolving Chrome-related technical issues.

## User Interface

We used the popular Python library, **Tkinter**, for the user interface. It provides a set of modules and classes to build desktop applications with a rich and interactive interface.

## Utilizing the aima3 Package

The **aima3** package, short for "**Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach**" provides a compre
hensive set of tools for building intelligent systems. It offers functionality for logic programming,
knowledge representation, and inference, which are essential components for creating an expert
system. By leveraging the capabilities of the aima3 package, we are able to develop a robust and
efficient solution for Chrome support.
